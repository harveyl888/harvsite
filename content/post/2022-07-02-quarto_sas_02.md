An earlier [post](/post/2022-06-27-quarto_sas/) demonstrated how the jupyter SAS kernel could be used to run SAS from within a Quarto document.  This post demonstrates the saspy library and how SAS can be incorporated into Quarto, ultimately passing data to an interactive observable visualization.

# Setup and Configure

saspy needs to be installed and configured.  See the [previous post](/post/2022-06-27-quarto_sas/) for details on configuring `sascfg_personal.py` and `_authinfo files`.
